refactor(structure): standardize directory naming to k-*

- Renamed crates directories to match `kitchnsink` convention:
  - `crates/kitchn_lib` -> `crates/k-lib`
  - `crates/kitchn_cli` -> `crates/k-bin`
  - `crates/kitchn_ffi` -> `crates/k-ffi`
  - `crates/kitchn_log` -> `crates/k-log`
- Updated workspace and crate-level `Cargo.toml` files.
- Verified build and tests.
